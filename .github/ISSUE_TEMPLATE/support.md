Please understand that this project is maintained by volunteers, and that answering support
tickets to help with specific, personal issues is time consuming, mentally exhausting, and
is time not spend in improving the software itself.

Saying hi, thank you and clearly describing what you tried and what happened would be
fantastic. In order for the answer to be easy to find for other people hitting the same
thing, please write a short summary in the title ("problem" and "doesn't work" are very
depressing to read, and don't make a description unique - show that you can do better!)

Make sure that you are using the last version (downloaded from this repository or installed
via Homebrew), and that you read the documentation. If you did read the documentation, copy
and paste the code you saw to this ticket in order to give it a high priority.

If you are not using the default configuration (Fine! This is a configuration after all),
try the default configuration, changing only the listening IP addresses if necessary.
Many reported issues were actually due to too many changes having been made at the same
time, making it difficult to pinpoint which one didn't work as expected. So, start with
a standard configuration and do small, incremental changes.

The only supported way to install the service is `dnscrypt-proxy -service install`.
After having tried it interactively interactively.

You already saw `dnscrypt-proxy -resolve` in the documentation. If you are experiencing
resolution issues, use this command to resolve DNS queries for diagnostics, not a web
browser. If responses are printed just fine while domain names don't resolve in the
web browser, the actual issue is likely to be located in 3rd party software such as
dnsmasq.

Maintainers may not use your operating system and hardware. In order to respond to
questions on environments they don't know about, the best they can do is do a Google
search, as an attempt to solve a problem you have, but that they don't have. You are
the one who knows your own environment the best. So, take some time trying to solve
issues on your own first; this is by far the best way to understand how the whole
thing works. Answering our own question right after having formulated it happens
all the time!

Finally, if the issue is solved, and this is something that wouldn't have happened if
it had been documented, feel free to proudly improve the documentation (it is a wiki).

Thanks for reading all this, and have a wonderful day.
